But don't be affraid to extend it with: `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.


And `short-desc` part should be used with a kebab-case naming convention, eg.: `fix-button-shadow`, `add-missing-colors`.

```
feat/button-component
fix/add-missing-colors
refactor/refactor-button-styles
test/add-button-tests
chore/add-package
```
